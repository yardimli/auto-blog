<h2>1. Purpose, Educational Methods, and Teaching Location</h2>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>We hope that during his learning process, he will have the opportunity to use languages he is familiar with in daily life, whether it's Mandarin, Turkish, sign language, or other communication methods. We want to continue providing him with an environment where he can use skills he is familiar with to learn and share ideas.</p>
<p>Extending from this point, we believe that knowledge and skills that are important and practical for his life should be integrated into the teaching methods, incorporating life experiences. This allows him to have choices in learning methods and understand how to express himself.</p>
<p>We expect him to gain new experiences from learning activities, whether psychological or physical, helping him learn to adapt and cope with his specific needs in life. We hope he can freely develop his personality.</p>

<h3>Educational Methods</h3>
<p>We need to give him opportunities to learn from mistakes. If the content is suitable, we can take turns answering or switch roles to make him feel the atmosphere of collaborative learning. If Yi-Luo shows boredom, impatience, or inability to understand the teaching method, we must change our teaching approach or the subject matter.</p>
<p>He will acquire knowledge from physical objects, computer-based teaching tools, or activities. If the teaching tools we need are unavailable on the market, we will make them ourselves. To achieve the best motivation for learning, every subject should have at least one alternative guidance method or thematic scenario prepared to adapt to Yi-Luo's mood, interests, and observed psychological growth at the time.</p>
<p>From homeschooling until now, his mind has been constantly growing, from being unable to participate in any learning activities to accepting this responsibility. There was a period when his emotions fluctuated greatly; during such times, we would find times when he was more psychologically balanced to have lessons, or try sitting quietly for 5 minutes before class, or walk/run on the treadmill for a few meters to calm down before starting. There was also a period when he couldn't complete an activity lasting at least 20 minutes; then, we had to observe which type of content was more suitable for this period, or divide the day into shorter segments for lessons. Sometimes Yi-Luo cared a lot about the lesson content; we would then observe his reaction to find the reason for his dislike, and sometimes it was simply because he had many changes in life he needed to overcome, so the lesson content needed to be easier and more repetitive.</p>

<hr class="page-break">

<!-- Page 4 -->
<h3>Teaching Location</h3>
<p>Yi-Luo has two places for learning activities: one at home, and one is a room we prepared for him at our company. Previously, we taught him new content both at home and in the company room. This year, we hope to use the company environment to cultivate his ability to independently complete assigned tasks, just like how he comes up with ideas for play.</p>
<p>Regarding music and visual arts courses, we still conduct them at home or in the outdoor garden. For physical activity, we have prepared a gymnastics room at home where he can do exercises requiring eye-hand-foot coordination and agility training, as well as activities that help him supplement sensory input or relieve excess sensory input at other times. We also use the sports fields and equipment provided in parks to let him experience different sports activities.</p>

<h3>Extracurricular Teaching Location</h3>
<p>To increase life experience, and learn and find coping mechanisms when encountering difficulties.</p>

<h2>2. Student's Current Situation Description</h2>

<p>[IMAGE PLACEHOLDER]</p>

<h3>Personality Description</h3>
<p>Yi-Luo is happy, observant, independent, and persistent. Compared to before, he has become more aware of his own feelings and environmental settings. We have also noticed him expressing, bit by bit in his own way, his desire for autonomy, such as sleeping until dawn by himself, and indicating that we should continue working in our workroom instead of sitting on the sofa in his room waiting with him. We understand that the process of this change is not smooth, as he cannot easily articulate his current feelings and emotions verbally. We will observe for a period, suggest he try different approaches, see his reaction, and then tell him our observations, guessing what emotions and cognitions he might be experiencing and how to describe them.</p>
<p>Often, Yi-Luo feels the need to discipline himself because the emotional ups and downs caused by major and minor life events are not simple. However, when faced with things we cannot change, such as the death due to kidney failure of a cat he had been with since childhood, Yi-Luo did not become as emotional and disruptive to his daily routine as we expected. He went through a period of intense sadness, crying sorrowfully, but under our observation, he accepted this fact with very positive emotions.</p>
<p>Yi-Luo tries to solve problems by himself, but sometimes, because he wants too much to solve difficulties on his own, he doesn't seek our help, which instead makes him anxious or tense. His approach to challenges involves understanding the origin of things, observing and comparing, and exploring through trial-and-error experimentation.</p>

<h3>Current Interests</h3>
<p>Yi-Luo still enjoys videos and music, but he is somewhat less interested in playing the computer games he used to like. However, he has started to enjoy walking outdoors or exploring new streets in the city again. Now, Yi-Luo is more likely to control the camera lens on his phone, so he doesn't keep it on constantly like before. He likes recording new experiences; for him, taking the elevator instead of the stairs to the company office for a day counts as a new experience. Afterwards, he enjoys reviewing the videos he recorded, looking closely at places he didn't notice at the time or listening to sounds he couldn't hear clearly then.</p>

<hr class="page-break">

<!-- Page 6 -->
<p>He is quite sensitive to sound and easily immerses himself in the emotions of music. Yi-Luo likes to use multiple windows on the computer, playing music or movie background scores/sound effects via Spotify or Apple TV, while simultaneously playing his own recorded videos to create different situational experiences.</p>
<p>Additionally, Yi-Luo sometimes likes to pretend he is fixing things or finding things to do in the garden.</p>

<h3>Health Status</h3>
<p>Yi-Luo has no negative health conditions; he is very energetic. His dental experiences make him worried and anxious, sometimes affecting his sleep, but he likes to wash his teeth before bed while listening to music. He can try new foods more easily, but for fruits, he is still only willing to eat bananas. The weight gain caused by medication side effects has significantly improved since his psychiatrist changed his medication.</p>

<h3>Learning Attitude</h3>
<p>Yi-Luo understands his daily responsibility to attend classes. He usually concentrates better during morning classes, regardless of the subject, and the learning outcomes are better. We have observed some behaviors akin to practicing exercises outside of learning, but he needs us nearby. He shows continuous development in understanding our verbal instructions and his own visual observation of learning goals during lessons.</p>
<p>Yi-Luo is now less likely to have emotional outbursts due to inability to concentrate and getting answers wrong; it's more about not being able to complete the lesson. Usually, changing the goal, for example, from completing 20 questions to doing them for another 15 minutes, or from needing 20 minutes of class time to achieving at least 70 points, or taking turns answering questions with him, can encourage him to concentrate and help him continue participating in the lesson. Sometimes we observe that he just wants to do something else first; we guide him to express this using sign language or words, hoping to familiarize him with using language first as a spontaneous reaction. He is making progress in this area.</p>

<h3>Family Members</h3>
<p>Mother, Father, 1 dog, and 1 cat.</p>

<hr class="page-break">

<!-- Page 7 -->
<h3>Interpersonal Interaction</h3>
<p>Yi-Luo's emotional expressions are direct; his preferences for environments or people are quickly established. Familiar people or those he decides he likes will get his attention. In situations where he already dislikes a person or environment, it is more difficult to persuade him to accommodate them.</p>
<p>In situations he deems safe and with people he likes, we have observed that Yi-Luo is more likely to proactively express his thoughts or try to understand what others are doing or what is about to happen. His personality is rather impatient, so he prefers faster communication methods like sign language or body language. At home or with us, because the situation is usually not urgent, he will also mix various media for communication, such as pictures, Google Maps, video clips, etc.</p>
<p>Yi-Luo enjoys going to the office with the family dog after class. Compared to before, his awareness of changes in the office atmosphere has increased. When everyone is concentrating on work, he either works on things in his own room or deliberately does things to attract everyone's attention. When everyone is relaxed, he interacts with people using his communication methods. The things he wants to express are more complex than before; for example, it's not just wanting to play with the iPad, but expressing that he wants to play in front of the window behind someone, while simultaneously hoping that person continues sitting in the nearby chair.</p>
<p>In noisy, crowded environments (like large shopping malls), he doesn't pay much attention to social norms and gets easily distracted, but he can be reminded and will comply.</p>
<p>Yi-Luo enjoys sharing food with the family cat and dog.</p>

<h3>Teaching Methods</h3>
<p>Morning learning at home focuses on new content, while afternoon learning in the classroom prepared for him at our company emphasizes practicing independent completion of certain tasks. We adjust learning goals and schedules very flexibly according to Yi-Luo's individual condition at the time.</p>
<p>This spring, we started letting him try out a reward point system based on daily life activities during lessons. We observed that he could understand the purpose, so this year we will continue to expand the reward point system rules within curriculum activities. Reward points earned from daily life can be exchanged for toys he particularly wants, visits to special places he desires, reclaiming time for using his phone, iPad, or computer. The rules are limited to life tasks, such as remembering to regulate his emotions, remembering to communicate verbally first rather than using negative emotions when expressing needs or ideas, remembering not to express anger negatively if waking up suddenly at night, remembering to pick up toys from the floor and put them away before sleep, etc. The reward points from learning activities provide him with a quantifiable concept of his learning goals for the day, the week, or the month.</p>

<hr class="page-break">

<!-- Page 9 -->
<p>The reward point system is somewhat similar to earning course credits, but the rules are more detailed, so in some ways, it's like a supermarket point collection activity for rewards. Generally speaking, reward point tasks in the curriculum involve doing things related to the lessons, e.g., creating 10 sentences using specific color words earns 2 points, recognizing and practicing fraction multiplication calculations for 30 minutes earns 5 points. The number of reward points for each rule item is assessed based on difficulty and the time he takes to complete it, and they are also divided into two main categories: repeatable and non-repeatable tasks. This is because currently, the method we've tried with Yi-Luo is telling him that regardless of which rule item he chooses, the total points needed are 5; once he gets 5 points, the class is over. We've observed that he can understand this rule, which eases the pressure of learning. For example, when we remind him he still needs 3 points, his acceptance is much better than telling him he has 10 minutes left until class ends.</p>
<p>We first try out tasks with Yi-Luo to know how many reward points an item is worth. We hope he can spend at least 30 minutes participating in the lesson (totaling 5 points). If a task is difficult, completing it earns more points. If it's simple, he gets fewer points, requiring him to choose several more items. This gives him some psychological preparation and flexibility in planning. The reason for categorizing tasks as repeatable or non-repeatable is that we feel some items lose meaning if repeated continuously within 30 minutes, or he might lose concentration if repeating the same task over and over.</p>
<p>Currently, we first select which task to do because when we tried it with Yi-Luo, he was unwilling or unable to decide which item to choose. We hope he can gradually develop his own preferences regarding task selection.</p>
<p>Our teaching method is 1-on-1, but we hope to try involving extended family members to let him experience others' perspectives. We try to establish interactive ways that make the lessons interesting for him, allowing us to participate together in Yi-Luo's learning process.</p>
<p>Currently, learning content is primarily text and multimedia-based, with most lessons conducted on the computer. Regardless of the subject, if suitable, we watch together and take turns doing tasks. We design content that allows us and Yi-Luo to execute and achieve goals together, thereby increasing his learning motivation.</p>

<hr class="page-break">

<!-- Page 10 -->
<p>Besides Chinese and Turkish for language learning, Math, Science, Music, and Multimedia Design are taught in English, while extracurricular activities often occur in mixed-language environments.</p>
<p>Science, Music, and Visual Arts are integrated into life activities. Depending on the activity content, lessons might be in the classroom, kitchen, garden, home hardware workshop, or outdoor forest. Regardless of the subject, this academic year, we hope to strengthen the application of learned knowledge to daily life.</p>

<h3>Learning Assessment Methods</h3>
<p>Every lesson will have an assessment, or sometimes a record of reward points. These results can be converted to show the frequency of practice for each item within a subject, the time spent, the number of questions answered correctly, etc. Additionally, we use "Poor," "Okay," "Good" as assessment levels. Assessment items for each subject include "Attention," "Interest Expression," and "Learning Outcome," assessed daily and weekly. We also conduct a weekly summary and adjust the following week's lesson content based on this summary. All assessment results are recorded on paper and digitally.</p>

There, I worked as a piano accompanist with music conservatory students and also illustrated children's books. During my time as an accompanist and illustrator, my interest in programming gradually grew, and I began self-studying software programming. I started by designing front-end web pages and online music players for publishing houses. As I deepened my research into web software programming and Windows desktop software development, I started taking on related projects full-time. Most projects involved creating and maintaining online stores and accounting software for a bookstore owner who partnered with my husband and me. During this period, my interests also led me to self-study related physics and electrical engineering fields concerning robotics. For the same reason, my husband and I opened a workshop creating robotics teaching materials. The workshop operated until we decided to move back to Taiwan. We moved back in 2012, and soon after, my husband and I started a software development company, which we co-manage to this day.</td></tr>
